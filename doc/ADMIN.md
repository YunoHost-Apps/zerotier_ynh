## Basic networking

You can get your node address, as well as list, join, and leave networks from the "Networks" configuration panel above.

## Advanced configuration

Open a terminal and use the `zerotier-cli` command. Refer to ZeroTier's documentation for more information.

## Configuring your own network
If you want to set a network up, use the [zeroui](https://apps.yunohost.org/app/zeroui) app.
