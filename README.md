## Overview

Zerotier sets up Global Area Networks.
It is basically an alternative to OpenVPN, where the devices are not dependent on a main VPN server but are connected peer-to-peer.


**Shipped version:** 1.12.2~ynh1
## Disclaimers / important information

**License:** [Business Source License 1.1](https://github.com/zerotier/ZeroTierOne/blob/master/LICENSE.txt).
Most personal and internal use cases are free. See their [pricing page](https://zerotier.com/pricing/) for more details.

This package only installs the ZeroTier service and sets it up.
Use `zerotier-cli` to configure your connections. Your network address is a 10-character-long alphanumeric string,
 which displayed in the installation logs and can also be retrieved with `zerotier-cli info`.

If you want to set a network up, use the [ztncui](https://github.com/YunoHost-Apps/ztncui_ynh) app.
After creating a network, join it with `zerotier-cli join $the_networkd_id`.

## :red_circle: Antifeatures
