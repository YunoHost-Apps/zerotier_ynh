## Overview
Zerotier sets up Global Area Networks. It is basically an alternative to OpenVPN, where the devices are not dependent on a main VPN server but are connected peer-to-peer.

**Shipped version:** 1.8.1

**License:** [Business Source License 1.1](https://github.com/zerotier/ZeroTierOne/blob/master/LICENSE.txt). Most personal and internal use cases are free. See their [pricing page](https://zerotier.com/pricing/) for more details.

## Configuration

This app only installs the ZeroTier service and sets it up. Use `zerotier-cli` to configure your connections.

If you want to set a network up, use the [ztncui_ynh](https://github.com/tituspijean/ztncui_ynh) app.
After creating a network, join it with `zerotier-cli join $the_networkd_id`.
